### Practice with Mongoose, Express, MongoDB, and IronLauncher

This GitHub repository documents my journey of practicing and learning the fundamentals of building applications using Mongoose, Express, MongoDB, and the IronLauncher helper. Through this practice, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of backend development, database management, and the tools that streamline the development process.

### Why This Repository Exists

This repository was created to serve as a personal playground for experimenting with the Mongoose, Express, and MongoDB stack. I wanted to explore the capabilities of IronLauncher in accelerating the initial phases of project setup.
